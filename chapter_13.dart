// Object oriented concepts


// ****** Class ******
/*
    Dart classes are defined as the the blueprint of the associated
    objects.A class is a user-defined data type that describes the 
    characteristics and behavious of it.To get all properties of the
    class, we must create an object of that class
*/

/*
    class ClassName{
        // fields
        // getters and setters
        // constructors
        // functions
    }
*/

// ****** Object ******
/*
    An object is a real-life entity such as a table,human,etc.The object
    has two characteristics- state and behaviour.
    We access the class propteties using an object of that class.
*/

/*
    var objectName = new ClassName(<constructor_arguments>);
    ClassName objectName = new ClassName(<constructor_arguments>);
*/

// ****** Inheritance ******
/*
    Dart supports inheritance,which is used to create new classes from
    existing class.The class that to be extended is call parent/superclass
    and newly created class is called child/subclass.
    Dart provides extends keyword to inherit propeties of parent class
    in child class
*/

/*
    class ChildClass extends ParentClassP{

    }
*/

// ****** interfaces ******
/*
    The interface is defined as a blueprint of the class.We can
    declare methods and variables inside the interfce just like the
    class but in interface only abstract declaratio of methods is 
    provided.We can only define the function signature but not its body.
    Another class can implement the interface.It is basically used for
    data hiding.
*/

// ****** Abstract Class ******
/*
    A class that contains one or more abstract method is called an
    abstract class.We can declare the abstract class using abstract
    keyword followed by class declaration.
*/

/*
    abstract class ClassName{
        // Body if abstract class.
    }
*/
